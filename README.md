# 🎓 Prediction of Students’ Score Based on Study Hours | ML Project – Data Series 15.0 by Dibimbing.id

This project aims to **predict students' test scores** based on the number of hours they studied using various **machine learning algorithms**. Built as part of *Data Series 15.0 by Dibimbing.id*, the project explores the relationship between study effort and performance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

We explored a simple linear relationship between:
- `Hours` (🕒): Number of hours studied.
- `Scores` (📈): Test scores obtained by the students.

Several regression models were applied:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

The goal was to determine which model performs best in predicting student scores with high accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset

- Total Observations: `25`
- Features: 
  - `Hours`: Continuous variable (independent)
  - `Scores`: Continuous variable (dependent)

## 🏁 Outcome

- The best-performing model was chosen based on **predictive accuracy** and **evaluation metrics**.
- The result provides insights into how increased study time can significantly impact students' performance.
- This mini project also serves as a solid foundation for understanding the application of basic ML models on small datasets.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
- etc.
